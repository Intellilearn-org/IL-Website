/* You can add very high-level App container styles here if needed */

/*
  This rule hides the HTML element with id="contact".
  This is based on the common practice of assigning an ID to each section
  for navigation (e.g., a "Contact" link in your Navbar would scroll to #contact).

  If your "Get in touch" section does not have the ID "contact",
  this rule will not work. You would need to identify the correct
  ID or a suitable unique class for that section.

  NOTE: This method only hides the section visually. The HTML and
  associated JavaScript for the Contact section will still be loaded by the browser.
  For complete removal, you should remove the <Contact /> component
  from your main application file (e.g., App.js or App.tsx).
  This would also involve removing any navigation links pointing to this section.
